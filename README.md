# DESCRIPTION :
The Sudoku Solver project is a C++ application developed with the Qt framework that solves Sudoku puzzles programmatically. Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. This application is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels, helping users find solutions quickly and effortlessly.
For the application to work, there should be atleast 17 valid entries in the 9x9 grid. 
After you input the numbers in their correct positions, clicking " SOLVE THE SUDOKU " will make the answer (solution grid) pop up next to the Question grid.
